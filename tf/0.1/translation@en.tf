865272	King, Sargon, king
of Agade of the broad squares,
strong king, who negotiates with the
gods. Adad gave him strength,
and from east
to west
I seized the land.
In one day
I fought against 70 cities;
their princes I took prisoner and
their cities I destroyed. By Adad, the lord of strength,
and Ishtar, the lade of battle,
I swear (to it). I saw a gazelle and
I threw a brick into the river. During
my running the inscription was loosened,
I set up the inscription. I ran and
caught the gazelle. (Then) I raised the brick
from the water. By Adad and Ishtar
I swear (to it). 1000 oxen and 6000
sheep I did indeed slaughter daily.
7000 of my heroes who daily eat
breast-meat before me,
3000 of my scouts,
who eat rump-meat,
1000 of my cupbearers, who
daily eat the top part
of the lower leg up to
the roasted part
... invited.
7000 of my heroes
ate breast-meat.
There was not enough breast-meat
for the rear. His ox,
the ... of his throne,
he slaughtered and he gave the breast-meat
to the rear. My cook
distributed the cuts of meat.
As a punishment 100 oxen
and 200 sheep he slaughtered,
and he fed it to my servants. By Adad
and Ishtar I swear (to it). For seven years, one month
and 15 days I stayed with
my creditors at the meal.
Upon my leaving, I did indeed bind
a rod of carnelian and lapis lazuli, and
I did distribute it over the land.
At mount Amanum, which
I defeated twice, i set up a statue
like a foundation peg in its middle.
The prince
of Tukrish I dressed with a skin.
In Hutura, I placed ... on their heads.
I covered their heads like
that of a woman
with an Alasian (cloth). Those of Amurru,
like their fathers,
their ... of the land, I finished. Those of Kilaru
I bound their heads
in a bundle. Again, the people of Kanesh
their ... I let loose.
Those of Hatu, the midst of their heads I skinned. Of Luhme
the toggle-pin I sharpened, the Gutian one. Lullum and Hahhum, their ... I made rich.
The four posts of heaven I touched with hand. Why should I enlarge
what is on the tablet? Anum does not know how I am king, (and) how I
took the lower and the upper country.
May Adad, the king, make my offering abundant.
899113	Thus Pilahaya, Nima-Assur
and Mannum-balum-Assur,
to Ellil-bani

12 1/2 shekels, “add-ons”; 2 1/2 shekels

6 shekels of silver to the account

will not let me receive here,
then I will take it from this silver!”

913031	From Buzutaja to [...],
Puzur-szadue, Aszszur-[...], Puszuken:
Because of the [...] of the [man?]
I confronted the city here and I got a tablet of the City
adressed to the primary assembly of the colony, which they bring (it) to you.
Therefore you should listen to the tablet of the City,
and you must confront the colony and (have it established) that it was the primary assembly of the colony,
and not I, who threw him into jail.
My dear brothers, take care and (get hold of) a tablet
of the Kanesz colony and a message from
the Puruszaddum colony, indicating that he cheated the Kanesz colony and (sold?) the iron
in Puruszhaddum. For that reason the primary assembly of the colony
[threw him into jail?]. Take care [...]
[to] the palace [...
[...]
[which] I gave to the palace, and to the palace [...]
held me back, and [...] 2 minas of silver to [...]
live; and for the orders of the palace, when I stayed
in jail you sold textiles for me.
When the iron and the textiles were sold in Aszszur-malik,
Kurub-Isztar, his brother Aszszur-imitti, son of Ikkupija,
Puzur-szadue and Aszszur-makik, son of Luzina, were my witnesses.
When the money was paid Ammurumbani, Szu-Kubum,
son of Aszszur-bel-awatim, Aszszur-malik son of Alahum,
Puzur-szadue and Aszszur-malik, son of Luzina,
went up to the palace together with (me) and I paid the money:
they are my witnesses. Seize the men and [lead them] to the Gate of the God
[...] in accordance with
[...]
[...]
of the iron he brought.
(he) said: also, take the iron [...]
of my partners [...] the iron [...]
and I will take [...]
I personaly will [...] our gate [...]
which I gave to him, Puzur-szadue [...]
913102	From Itur-ilī
to Ennam-Aššur
say: 8 minas of tiri-silver
I gave you,
8 minas of tiri-silver
under my seal Saḫarli
and Azu brought to you;
in all, 16 minas have come to you.
Why is it that
for yourself gold,
each shekel you made and
you sent here, but
to me nothing
you sent?
This is important: for
the 16 minas of silver red gold
for smelting
buy and with your servant
send to me! This is important:
a dishonest man
must not cheat you! To
drinking yourself
do not give! To white gold
your hand
do not lift.
You may not know that white tin
is plentiful here.
To Luzina
from Miszszu-rabi
and Ennum-Aszszur:
3 1/3 minas 6 shekels of silver
and 1/2 mina 2?/3 shekel of sza-gold

converted at the rate 8:1
Under the seal of Miszszu-rabi:

this brings (him) to you.
Further, 1/2 mina 4 shekels,

One donkey is dead. Two donkeys
6 saddle-skins , 3 bags,
